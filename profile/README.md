It’s fight week in London! Cage Warriors – Europe’s Leading MMA Organisation – is back in the UK fight capital with one of the biggest cards of the year!  In the evening’s main event, former middleweight champion James Webb looks to follow in the footsteps of Stevie Ray, Modestas Bukauskas, Nic Dalby and Dan Hardy with a second stint as CW champion.

To do that he’ll have to get past the reigning, defending Andy Clamp, as ‘The Vice’ puts the title he won earlier this year on the line for the first time.

In a pair of unfortunate changes to the card, the bantamweight title bout between champion Liam Gittins and PrizeFighter winner Shirzad Qadrian will now not take place, after the champion picked up an injury late in his training camp.

CW will look to rebook the fight at a later date.

The highly-anticipated lightweight bout between Tobias Harila and Adam Cullen has also fallen victim to the injury bug, with the Swede forced to withdraw just a week removed from the contest.

CW officials are currently seeking a new opponent for Cullen.

Elsewhere on a card packed with highlight-reel potential, bantamweights Alexander Lööf and Weslley Maia will meet in a clash of former PrizeFighter entrants.

TUF 32 participant Paddy McCorry makes his return to the promotion with designs on a middleweight title run; he’ll first have to get past durable veteran Tye Palmer.

Former title challenger Orlando Wilson Prins, Jimmy Quinn, Tariq Pell, Jawany Scott, Thomas Paull and more CW fan favourites are also in action on the 14 bout bill.

The final CW 180 card is as follows…
